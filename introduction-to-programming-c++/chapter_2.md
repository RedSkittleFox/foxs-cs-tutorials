Those two concepts are intrinsic to all C++ entities concept. Almost every entity can be declared and defined. Sometimes the definition is the declaration. Declaration is telling the compiler that something entity exists somewhere in the code. Definition is telling the compiler what the entity is. Declaration has to be avialable before the entity is used in the compiled code. Defintion just has to be avialable in one way or another before the code gets executed - either as a source code or in a form of library as a machine code.

I'm going to provide this example to give you the rough idea. It's going to be explained in depth in later chapters.
```cpp
// File a
int a; // declaration

// File b
int a = 5; // definition
```
